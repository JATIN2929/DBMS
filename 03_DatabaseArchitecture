🧱 What is Database Architecture?
Database Architecture refers to the design structure of a database system that shows how data is stored, managed, and accessed by users and applications.
It defines:
How different components of the database system interact
Where data is stored (locally or distributed)
How users connect to it

TYPES OF DATABASE ARCHITECTURE
There are mainly three major types of database architectures:
1-Tier Architecture
2-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture

🧩 1. Single-Tier Architecture (1-Tier)
🧠 Definition:

In 1-tier architecture, the database, application, and user interface all reside on the same machine.
The user interacts directly with the database without any intermediary.

📊 Structure:
User ↔ Database

🧰 Example:

Microsoft Access (where database and application run on one PC)
Local development systems

✅ Advantages:

Simple to design and manage

Fast because there is no network delay

❌ Disadvantages:

Not suitable for multi-user systems

Low security and scalability

🔗 2. Two-Tier Architecture (Client–Server Architecture)
🧠 Definition:

In 2-tier architecture, the system is divided into two layers:

Client (Front-end): User interface or application program

Server (Back-end): Database server that stores and manages data

The client sends SQL queries to the server, and the server returns results.

📊 Structure:
Client Application ↔ Database Server

🧰 Example:

Applications using ODBC, JDBC, or Oracle Client

A bank’s teller system where front-end apps access a central database

✅ Advantages:

Faster response than 3-tier

Easier to maintain than 1-tier

❌ Disadvantages:

Business logic is shared between client and server, making updates harder

Limited scalability (more clients = more load on server)

🌐 3. Three-Tier Architecture
🧠 Definition:

Three-tier architecture separates the system into three independent layers:

Presentation Layer (Client/UI) – What the user sees and interacts with

Application Layer (Business Logic) – Handles logic, rules, and data processing

Database Layer (Data Storage) – Stores and manages data

📊 Structure:
Client (UI)
     ↓
Application Server (Logic)
     ↓
Database Server (Data)

🧰 Example:

Web applications using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Middle layer: Java, Python, or PHP

Database: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL

✅ Advantages:

High security (users can’t access the database directly)

Easy to scale and maintain

Business logic and data are separated

❌ Disadvantages:

More complex to set up

Slightly slower because of extra communication between layers
