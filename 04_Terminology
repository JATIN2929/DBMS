Basic Database Terminology
1. Data

Definition:
Raw facts and figures that have no meaning on their own.
Example: 101, Ravi, 15, Delhi

When processed, it becomes information.
Example: Student ID 101 belongs to Ravi, age 15, from Delhi.

2. Database

Definition:
A collection of related data organized in a structured way so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Example:
A school database might contain data about:

Students

Teachers

Courses

Fees

3. Table (Relation)

Definition:
In a Relational Database, data is stored in tables.
Each table is called a Relation.

Structure:
A table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

Example:

Roll_No	Name	Age	City
101	Ravi	15	Delhi
102	Meena	14	Pune

Here,

Table name: Student

Columns: Roll_No, Name, Age, City

Rows: Data of each student

4. Attribute (Column / Field)

Definition:
An attribute is a column in a table that represents a property or characteristic of an entity.

Example:
In the Student table above:

Attributes are → Roll_No, Name, Age, City

Each attribute stores data of one kind (e.g., all names or all ages)

5. Tuple (Row / Record)

Definition:
A tuple represents a single record or row in a table.

Example:
In the Student table:

(101, Ravi, 15, Delhi) → is one tuple

(102, Meena, 14, Pune) → another tuple

Each tuple represents one complete set of data for a student.

6. Domain

Definition:
A domain is the set of all possible values that an attribute can take.

Example:

Domain of Age = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, …}

Domain of City = {Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, …}

Each attribute has its own domain.

7. Degree (of a Relation)

Definition:
The number of attributes (columns) in a table is called its degree.

Example:
If a Student table has 4 attributes → Roll_No, Name, Age, City
➤ Degree = 4

8. Cardinality (of a Relation)

Definition:
The number of tuples (rows) in a table is called its cardinality.

Example:
If the Student table has 5 students → Cardinality = 5

Roll_No	Name	Age	City
101	Ravi	15	Delhi
102	Meena	14	Pune
103	Anil	15	Chennai
104	Riya	16	Mumbai
105	Ajay	14	Delhi

So,
Degree = 4, Cardinality = 5

9. Entity

Definition:
An entity is any real-world object that can be identified and stored in the database.
Each entity has attributes that describe it.

Example:

Student, Teacher, Course, Employee, Car, etc.

10. Entity Set

Definition:
A collection of similar entities.

Example:
All students in a school form a Student entity set.

11. Relation

Definition:
A relation is a table with columns (attributes) and rows (tuples) in a relational database.

Mathematically, a relation is a set of tuples sharing the same attributes.

12. Relational Schema

Definition:
The structure or blueprint of a table that defines its attributes and their data types.

Example:

Student(Roll_No, Name, Age, City)


This means:
Table Student has attributes Roll_No, Name, Age, City.

13. Relation Instance

Definition:
The actual content (data) stored in a table at a specific time.

Example:
If you add or remove rows from the Student table, the relation instance changes.

14. Primary Key

Definition:
An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies each tuple in a table.

Example:

In Student, Roll_No can be the primary key.

No two students can have the same Roll_No.

15. Foreign Key

Definition:
An attribute in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, used to link related data.

Example:

Student Table:

Roll_No	Name	Class_ID
101	Ravi	10
102	Meena	11

Class Table:

Class_ID	Class_Name
10	X
11	XI

Here, Class_ID in Student is a Foreign Key referencing Class.Class_ID.

16. Candidate Key

Definition:
All attributes that can uniquely identify a record are called candidate keys.
One of them becomes the primary key.

Example:
In Student table:

Roll_No and Aadhaar_No both can uniquely identify a student.

Both are candidate keys, but Roll_No is chosen as primary key.

17. Alternate Key

Definition:
The remaining candidate keys after choosing the primary key.

Example:
If Roll_No is primary, then Aadhaar_No becomes the alternate key.

18. Composite Key

Definition:
A key formed by combining two or more attributes to uniquely identify a record.

Example:
In a Marks table:
(Student_ID, Subject_ID) together form the composite key, since one student can appear in many subjects.

19. Super Key

Definition:
Any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.

Example:
In Student:
{Roll_No}, {Roll_No, Name}, {Roll_No, Age} — all are super keys
(but only the minimal one is the primary key)

20. Relationship

Definition:
A relationship describes how two or more entities are connected in a database.

Example:

Student enrolls in Course

Teacher teaches Subject

21. Relationship Set

Definition:
A collection of similar relationships between entity sets.

Example:
All the "enrollment" records between students and courses form a relationship set.

22. Cardinality of Relationship

Definition:
The number of instances of one entity related to another entity.

Types:

One-to-One (1:1) – Each entity in A is related to one in B
Example: A person has one passport

One-to-Many (1:N) – One entity in A relates to many in B
Example: One teacher teaches many students

Many-to-One (N:1) – Many in A relate to one in B
Example: Many students belong to one class

Many-to-Many (M:N) – Many in A relate to many in B
Example: Students enroll in many courses
